What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing creates a .git hidden directory which will contain repository and version information. You need to do this to distinguish a regular directory from a repository and be able to use version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is like a holding pen that lets you review your potential commits before you actually commit. It also allows you to 'group' files together that you deem connected or related.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
With the staging area you can use 'git status' to ensure that the logical change you make is only contained in the files in the staging area. This means you can check on what will be commited before the next 'git commit' command. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches are useful if you want to test out a new experimental feature. Branches help because you can keep the experimental code separate from the master branch code.
