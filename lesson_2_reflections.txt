What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing creates a .git hidden directory which will contain repository and version information. You need to do this to distinguish a regular directory from a repository and be able to use version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is like a holding pen that lets you review your potential commits before you actually commit. It also allows you to 'group' files together that you deem connected or related.
