When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you have an open source project you want to share, a remote repository is a good idea.  If you have code that you worked on and you want to look at online, pushing it onto a remote repository is also a good idea. You can also share your work online to demonstrate your work to potential employers or colleagues.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You could want full control of your local and not pull in any changes just yet. If Git automatically pulls for you and you might not expect it, this could cause confusion.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is an action on a local repository where you make a copy of a commit and begin making changes on this parallel copy. It is useful for testing out new features or perhaps debugging a fix you want to test before merging back with the master branch.  A branch can only be performed when you have a clone or fork of a repository.
A clone is a copy of a repository from either a local repository or a remote repository. The clone will contain all the information of the cloned(original) repository such as commit information.
A fork is an operation in GitHub that allows you to copy a repository directly into your GitHub account. You can then clone it into your local machine or make changes directly in GitHub.
You would fork instead of clone if you want to save the step of cloning someone's repository and then committing and pushing it back into your account. Forking also allows users to see where the original repository was and also to give credit to the original owner.
